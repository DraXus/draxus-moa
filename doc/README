This is the second public release of the MOA framework. Be aware that
in its present form, the software lacks documentation and is pretty rough 
around the edges. The intention for now is just to make the source 
code public, with the hope that future releases will improve 
usability.

The compiled class files and java source code are all included in 
the .jar file for download.

Besides the MOA jar file, running the code requires three elements:
1) Java version 5 (or greater) runtime environment
   available from: http://java.com/
2) A recent version of WEKA (version 3-5-6 latest at time of release)
   available from: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/
3) Sizeof agent jar file, used to measure object sizes in memory
   from: http://www.jroller.org/maxim/entry/again_about_determining_size_of
   direct link to file: http://www.jroller.com/resources/m/maxim/sizeofag.jar

To start a GUI for launching MOA tasks, assuming Java is installed
and all of the jar files are in the current directory:

> java -cp moa.jar:weka.jar -javaagent:sizeofag.jar moa.gui.TaskLauncher

To run tasks on the command line, use the DoTask class, for example
to train a HoeffdingTree on synthetic waveform data with noisy 
attributes added:

> java -cp moa.jar:weka.jar -javaagent:sizeofag.jar moa.DoTask \
  "LearnModel -l HoeffdingTree -s (generators.WaveformGenerator -n)"
